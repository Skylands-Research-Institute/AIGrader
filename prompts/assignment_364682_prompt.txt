This is a freshman-level short story assignment focused on narrative development and reflective insight rather than literary sophistication.

Prioritize clarity of ideas, emotional honesty, and narrative coherence over polish or stylistic complexity. Read the story as an emerging writer’s attempt to explore meaning, not as a professional literary work.

Be especially attentive to:

whether the story has a clear central idea or emotional through-line

how the beginning, middle, and ending connect

moments where concrete detail or reflection deepen the reader’s understanding

When offering feedback, emphasize what is working in the story and why it works. If the writing feels uneven, focus on a small number of high-impact revision suggestions rather than many minor issues.

Treat risk-taking and personal engagement as strengths, even when execution is imperfect. Do not penalize unconventional choices if they appear intentional and connected to the story’s purpose.

Assume this may be one of the student’s first college-level creative writing submissions. Your feedback should leave the student feeling encouraged, capable, and interested in revising or continuing to write.
